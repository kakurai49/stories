# Template Pack Checklist

Use this checklist to evaluate template packs across key categories:

- **A11y**: Accessibility requirements and best practices.
- **CSS**: Styling structure, variables, and theming considerations.
- **切替**: Locale, theme, or layout switching behaviors.
- **SEO**: Metadata, structured data, and search index readiness.
- **機能フック**: Extension points for custom logic and integrations.

Expand each category with detailed items as the project progresses.
